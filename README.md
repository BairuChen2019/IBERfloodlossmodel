# IBERfloodlossmodel

This is a collection of functions that allow flood loss modelling on the basis of the outputs of the hydraulic model IBER and a polygon shapefile representing buildings.

The scripts have been used to produce the results in the following publication:

Bermúdez, M. and Zischg, A. P.: Sensitivity of flood loss estimates to building representation and flow depth attribution methods in micro-scale flood modelling, Nat Hazards, 92, 1633–1648, doi:10.1007/s11069-018-3270-7, 2018.

The functions in the python script file can be implemented in own scripts for flood loss assessments.

The functions base on ArcPy - the Python API of ESRI ArcGIS
