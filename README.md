# IBERfloodlossmodel

This is a collection of functions that allow flood loss modelling on the basis of the outputs of the hydraulic model IBER and a polygon shapefile representing buildings.
The functions in the python script file can be implemented in own scripts for flood loss assessments.

The functions base on ArcPy - the Python API of ESRI ArcGIS
